## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `bun install` | Install dependencies |
| `bun dev` | Start dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `bun build` | Build production site to `./dist/` |

---

## Customizing

The lessons walk you through all of this, but here's a quick overview:

- **Shelter name and branding** → Edit the components in `src/components/`
- **Colors** → Update the theme in `src/styles/global.css`
- **Pages** → Rename or add pages in `src/pages/`
- **Content** → Edit the Astro components directly (they're just HTML with superpowers)
- **Dog data** → Managed through Supabase (database + photo storage)

## Live Deployment: capapvl.pt

This repo is also the live website for **CAPA Póvoa de Lanhoso** — a Portuguese non-profit rescue, shelter, and adoption organization.

**Live site:** [capapvl.pt](https://capapvl.pt)

The deployment uses Supabase as the backend with ~104 dogs and ~980 photos. All public content is in Portuguese (PT). The site is hosted on Hostinger and auto-deploys from the `deploy` branch.

If you're looking for the template to fork for your own shelter, you're in the right place — this repo is both the template and the real thing.
