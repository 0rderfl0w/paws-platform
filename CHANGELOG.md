# CHANGELOG — capapvl.pt

## 2026-06-22
- Dog profiles: fixed the Playful gallery regression where real shelter photos could force the gallery wider than the profile container, clipping dogs off-screen on `/cao/` and `/en/dog/`; profile photos now fit inside a bounded card and the new browser verifier covers Athos, Abby, Alana, and English/mobile variants.
- Full-site Playful audit: moved the remaining public legacy surfaces (`/en/help/`, `/cao/`, `/en/dog/`, and `404.html`) onto CAPA's Playful Impact shell while leaving the noindex admin app routes as admin-only islands.
- Dog profiles: restyled the shared React profile island with Playful photo gallery, profile cards, compatibility chips, adopted/available CTA panels, and route-aware Playful nav/footer wrappers for Portuguese and English profile routes.
- Adoção/Adoption: redesigned the live `/adocao/` and `/en/adopt/` pages directly with the CAPA Playful Impact system while preserving the existing adoption benefits, process, fees, contact, and final CTA copy.
- Adoção/Adoption: added a stronger real-photo adoption-poster hero, locale-aware Playful section components, local hero image derivatives, route-scoped scroll reveal, bilingual content-preservation smoke coverage, and desktop/mobile screenshot QA.

## 2026-06-21
- Footer: linked the CAPA address to Google Maps in a new tab across Playful and legacy footers, and normalized the footer phone `tel:` href.
- Landing nav: changed the Playful landing menu's "Os Nossos Cães" / "Our Dogs" link from the in-page `#caes` anchor to the full listing routes `/caes` and `/en/dogs`.
- Footer: moved the Playful footer donation IBAN into a wider support pill spanning the help/contact columns on desktop, restored the full `PT50` IBAN formatting, and fixed the live-home footer phone link href.
- Accessibility: included adopted status in `/caes/` and `/en/dogs/` dog-card accessible names, changed Playful filter controls from fake tab semantics to pressed-button groups, and hardened live-home browser smoke cleanup/port allocation.
- Landing: promoted the Playful Impact `/test-landing/` experience to the live `/` and `/en/` home routes with canonical metadata, route-aware home/language links, shared page assembly, hydrated featured-dog browser smoke, and preserved `/test-landing/` as a noindex review reference.
- Cães/Dogs: redesigned the live `/caes/` and parity-safe `/en/dogs/` listing routes with the CAPA Playful Impact system while preserving hero copy, search/filter labels, result text, dog cards, profile links, API loading, and committed fallback data.
- Cães/Dogs: added a stronger real-photo adoption-poster hero collage, route-aware Playful chrome, tactile search/filter controls, Playful dog cards with visible adopted banners, static content smoke, and hydrated browser smoke for 99 dog cards, 9 adopted badges, and Abby adopted search.
- Sobre nós/About: redesigned the live `/sobre-nos/` and `/en/about/` pages directly with the CAPA Playful Impact system while preserving the bilingual origin, principles, community, rescue/rehabilitation, Zeus story, and dogs CTA copy.
- Sobre nós/About: added a stronger poster-style real-photo hero, locale-aware Playful section components, local hero image derivatives, route-scoped scroll reveal, and a bilingual content-preservation smoke script.
- Playful Impact: moved the shared scroll-reveal behavior into a reusable `PlayfulScrollReveal` component, kept MutationObserver support only for dynamic Playful routes, cleared long-lived `will-change` after reveal, and darkened the orange action token so white CTA text passes WCAG AA contrast.
- Ajudar: redesigned the live `/ajudar/` page directly with the CAPA Playful Impact system while preserving all existing help, donation, volunteer, FAT, payment, email, and CTA copy; added a stronger poster-style hero using a local real-photo fallback after image generation was unavailable in this environment.
- Ajudar: added route-aware Playful nav/footer chrome, tactile donation/volunteer/FAT/payment sections, route-scoped scroll reveal, a content-preservation smoke script, and desktop/mobile screenshot QA for the live help page redesign.
- Landing: added `/test-landing/` as a noindex production review page that preserves the current homepage copy and section flow while applying the Playful Impact design concept: cream canvas, Sora/Plus Jakarta Sans type, juicy orange CTAs, blob hero image treatment, pillowy cards, soft-brutalist rotations, and squishy interaction states.
- Landing: removed the accidental translucent white card behind the hero dog image so the image blob now floats directly over the cream hero background.
- Landing: added route-scoped scroll-reveal motion to `/test-landing/`: hero elements enter on load, section headers rise into view, cards pop/stagger as the user scrolls, dynamic dog cards are observed after React hydration, and reduced-motion users get static content.
- Dogs: kept the test landing's featured dogs backed by the existing Hetzner API plus committed fallback data, preserving size filters and `/cao?id=` profile links.
- Design docs: added `DESIGN.md` as the CAPA Playful Impact reference covering palette, typography, layout, motion, component rules, implementation notes, and QA checklist.
- Deploy: built with `PUBLIC_CAPA_API_URL=https://api.capapvl.org` and a fresh `CAPA_ASSET_VERSION`, synced `dist/` to `/home/deploy/apps/capapvl`, and verified live `/test-landing/` returns the new noindex page instead of the old 404 body while `/` remains the existing live homepage.

## 2026-06-19
- Dogs: marked Abby, Bella, Bolt, Buggy, Farrusco, Kiki, Klein, Mickey, and Mouse as adopted, and added a visible adopted banner on dog listing/profile photos.
- Dogs: removed deceased dogs Farrusca, Iman, Molly, Ringo, and Salsa from the public fallback dataset and public photo assets.
- Deploy: added a CAPA asset-version token to built Astro filenames and set HTML responses to `Cache-Control: no-cache` so browsers do not keep stale dog-listing JavaScript after status updates.

## 2026-06-10
- Go-live: moved CAPA public hosting to Hetzner under `https://capapvl.org`, with Namecheap DNS `A` records for `@`, `www`, and `api` pointing to `65.21.156.73`.
- Sobre nós/About: replaced the text-only dark hero on both Portuguese and English pages with a warmer split hero using a real CAPA dog-care photo, and updated Open Graph image/URL metadata for `capapvl.org`.
- Infra: deployed the Astro static build to `/home/deploy/apps/capapvl`, added nginx vhosts for `capapvl.org` and `api.capapvl.org`, and issued a Let's Encrypt certificate covering `capapvl.org`, `www.capapvl.org`, and `api.capapvl.org`.
- Routing: canonicalized `www.capapvl.org` to `https://capapvl.org`; `api.capapvl.org` proxies to the loopback Bun API on `127.0.0.1:3314`.
- Config: updated frontend/server API URLs from the old RichKapp bridge to `https://api.capapvl.org` while retaining `capapvl.pt` origins in the server allowlist for transitional compatibility.
- Verification: DNS resolved globally to Hetzner; HTTPS smokes returned 200 for the site and admin page, API health returned `{"ok":true}`, `/dogs` returned 104 dogs, and Playwright verified `/caes` loads 104 dog cards and API-served photos without console/page errors.

## 2026-06-04
- Security: hardened `capapvl-api.service` so `server/capa-api.ts` binds `127.0.0.1:3314` instead of a broad interface. Public API access remains through the temporary nginx HTTPS bridge at `https://richkapp.com/capapvl-api`; raw port `3314` must not be exposed publicly.
- Verification: local health and nginx-backed `richkapp.com/capapvl-api/health` smokes returned HTTP 200 after restart; external probe confirmed raw `3314` closed publicly.
- Docs: updated `AGENTS.md` with the loopback-bind requirement and raw-port gotcha.

## 2026-05-15
- Migration: Moved CAPA runtime data/auth/photo management off Supabase and onto a Hetzner Bun API backed by `capapvl_db`. Added `server/capa-api.ts`, persistent token auth, dog CRUD, status updates, photo upload/delete, and API-served dog images from `public/images/dogs`.
- Frontend: Replaced runtime Supabase calls in public dog listings, featured dogs, dog profiles, and admin with `src/lib/capaApi.ts`. Public pages still retain committed `src/data/capaDogs.ts` fallback data if the Hetzner API is unavailable.
- Infra: Added `capapvl-api.service` and an Nginx proxy path at `https://richkapp.com/capapvl-api` as a temporary HTTPS bridge until `api.capapvl.pt` DNS points to Hetzner and has its own certificate.
- Admin: Replaced the browser-local demo admin with Hetzner API authentication and persistent CRUD/status/photo management against `capapvl_db` plus `public/images/dogs`.
- Deploy: Pushed migration source to `main` (`0db0393`) and static output to `deploy` (`656da73`). Live Hostinger still served old `_astro/AdminPanel.DxKTiPf4.js` during verification, so hPanel manual Git deploy/reconnect is still required before production reflects the Hetzner API frontend.
- Deploy: Pushed source fix to `main` (`6c003c4`) and static output to `deploy` (`24bf174`). GitHub deploy branch contains `_astro/AdminPanel.DxKTiPf4.js`, but live `https://capapvl.pt/en/admin/` still serves old `_astro/AdminPanel.q4P30BYD.js`; Hostinger hPanel manual Git deploy/reconnect is required before production reflects the admin fallback.
- Recovery: Supabase project `amkwoeepuhlnjmybbnbo.supabase.co` returns NXDOMAIN while the public React islands still queried Supabase, causing `/caes` and homepage featured dogs to fall back to the 12-dog Unsplash seed list.
- Data: Generated `src/data/capaDogs.ts` from Hetzner `capapvl_db.public.dogs` (104 rows) and switched public dog listing/profile fallbacks to that local dataset.
- Photos: Restored 977 dog photos from `/Users/z/capapvl-photos-backup` into `public/images/dogs/` on Hetzner and updated the local dog dataset to use `/images/dogs/{slug}/photo-01.jpg` plus profile gallery photo arrays.
- Deploy: Committed and pushed source recovery to `main` (`fad3f16`) and static deploy output to `deploy` (`2d83c7c`). Hostinger had not pulled the new deploy branch during verification; hPanel manual Git deploy/reconnect may be required.
- Docs: Updated project `AGENTS.md` with the static fallback, restored photo path, live verification commands, and Hostinger deploy-stall warning. Also updated `/home/deploy/projects/websites/AGENTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` with CAPA's active repo and recovery state.
- Verification: `bun run build` passes; local `/caes` preview shows 104 dogs with real photos; dog profile pages render restored local galleries. Production still needs live-origin verification after Hostinger pulls the pushed deploy branch.
