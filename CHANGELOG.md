# CHANGELOG — capapvl.pt

## 2025-07-26
- Scaffolded Astro 5 project with React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Supabase client, Bun runtime (Crash & Burn)
- Note: Astro 5's official integration installs TW4 (not TW3). Using TW4 with CSS-first config — correct for new projects (Crash & Burn)
- Set up Supabase client lib, Dog type, seed data for 6 dogs (2 per size category) (Crash & Burn)
- Created warm earth-tone color palette: primary (orange), warm (brown), nature (green) (Crash & Burn)
- Built all 8 landing page sections: Nav (sticky + mobile hamburger), Hero, Stats (animated counters with IntersectionObserver), WhyAdopt (3 benefit cards), FeaturedDogs (React island with Supabase fetch + seed fallback + size filter tabs), AboutBlurb, HelpCta, Footer (Crash & Burn)
- FeaturedDogs uses client:visible for lazy loading, loading skeletons, empty states (Crash & Burn)
- `bun run build` clean — zero errors (Crash & Burn)
- Init git repo (Crash & Burn)

## 2026-02-24
- Project created. Stack: Astro 5 + React 19 + Tailwind 3 + Supabase + Bun. Hosted on Hostinger. (Crash & Burn)
- Researched current capapvl.pt site structure — hero, stats, why adopt, dog listings by size, about, help/FAT program (Crash & Burn)
- Created landing-page task spec (Crash & Burn)
