# Polish & Performance

## Goal
Final quality pass before handoff. Performance, design tweaks, remaining SEO.

## TODO
- [ ] Hero section — review with Z, may need further tweaking
- [ ] Performance audit: image lazy loading, bundle size, Lighthouse score
- [ ] Twitter card meta tags (currently only OG tags)
- [ ] Decide: contact form vs mailto links (ask Z)
- [ ] Review all pages on mobile viewport
- [ ] Check image sizes in `public/images/` — compress any over 200KB

## Nice-to-haves
- [ ] Bulk actions in admin (mark multiple dogs adopted, bulk delete)
- [ ] Structured age field (currently embedded in description text)

## Notes
- Hero has gone through multiple iterations — Z last saw the 2-column split layout (orange left, dog photo right)
- All public pages already have OG meta tags
- Images were resized during scrape but worth a second pass
